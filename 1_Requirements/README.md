## Rock Paper Scissor
 
*   Rock Paper and Scissors is a game played between two player by signing hand. The winner of the game is decided by using the following Logic.

*   What:
    It is a game application where two character plays games and take math questionaire to gain knowledge.
  
*   When:
    This application is done by Vivek Tiwari under LTTS StepIn miniproject .
  
*   Where:
    This application is developed using Visual Studio uploaded on github which is open source contributor environment.
  
*   How:
    A simple project which has multi-files in it and the program is made using structures and functions in C Programming Language.

<br>

  
## High Level Requirements


The necessary header files must be added to perform dynamic memory allocation, standard input/output functions, structures, pointers, looping statements such as for, while, switch-case, if and else-if ladder.

<br>



## Low Level Requirements

1. The header files required for the project are as follows
   *  <stdio.h> - to make use of standard input/output functions
   *  <string.h> - to make use of string functions
   *  <stdlib.h> - for dynamic memory allocation, pointers and system functions for the console widow
   *  <ctype.h> - to make use of variables of char type to obtain inputs from the console window.
2. The user must input the choice in the same format as displayed in the console window as it is case sensitive.
3. Based on the choice of the user, the console must display the computer's choice.
